        <h4>Change - Blind Melon</h4>
        <div class="cardInfoText">
          <p>In an interview with Details magazine for their July 1996 issue, Blind Melon manager Chris Jones explained that Shannon Hoon would sit on his mother's porch, singing this song over, and the family considers it a song of wonderful innocence; a song of hope. Said Jones: "He wrote it at the very end of a three-day coke binge in Indiana. During the first part I don't feel the sun's gonna come out today he was on the other side of the room, trying to see through the venetian blinds which were drawn so no light was coming in, and he was at a point where he couldn't even get up."</p>

        <h4>The Black Crowes - Seeing Things</h4>
        <div class="cardInfoText">
          <p>The Black Crowes were an American rock band formed in 1989. Their discography includes eight studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to Def American Recordings in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, the following year. The follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, reached the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992.</p>
          <p>After a hiatus between 2002 and 2005, the band released Warpaint, which hit number 5 on the Billboard chart. After the release of a greatest hits/acoustic double album Croweology in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that was followed by an ongoing second hiatus. The band announced that they would return in early 2013 but that December they returned to hiatus status with no specific return date. They announced their break-up in 2015.</p>
          <p>The band has sold over 30 million albums, and is listed at number 92 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. They were also labeled by Melody Maker as "The Most Rock 'n' Roll Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World" and the readers of Rolling Stone voted them 'Best New American Band' in 1990.</p>

        <h4>Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds- Grey Street</h4>
        <div class="cardInfoText">
          <p>"Grey Street" is the third and final radio single from Dave Matthews Band from their 2002 studio album, Busted Stuff. The first known recording of the song appears on the unofficially-released The Lillywhite Sessions, produced by Steve Lillywhite. The song revolves around the story of a girl who is consumed with feelings of loneliness, boredom and powerlessness. Color—and the lack thereof—are motifs in the song. The song has been played to date more than 450 times in concert, most often in 2000 and in 2002. Dave Matthews has also admitted that the song is inspired by the life of the poet Anne Sexton. Originally, this song had three verses, but since December 2002, live performances of it have only featured the first two</p>

        <h4>Our Lady Peace - In Repair</h4>
        <div class="cardInfoText">
          <p>Raine Maida stated that the lyrics "focus upon how people tend to treat each other as machines in our day-to-day life. We really need to take stock and focus our energy towards those in our lives that matter. Sometimes it seems as if we need an oil change."</p>
          <p>The song, as with most songs from the Spiritual Machines album, follows a theme concerning a futuristic artificially intelligent and robotic society, as described in Ray Kurzweil's 1999 book The Age of Spiritual Machines. In both the original release of the song and its second release as part of OLP's A Decade compilation album in 2006, the song is immediately preceded by a track entitled "R.K. 2029", which is a narration from Kurzweil's book read aloud by Kurzweil himself.</p>

        <h4>Our Lady Peace - Superman's Dead</h4>
        <div class="cardInfoText">
          <p>"Superman's Dead" is a song by Canadian alternative rock group Our Lady Peace. It was released in December 1996 as the lead single from their second album Clumsy. This has become one of Our Lady Peace's most popular songs in both Canada and the U.S., as well as many other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>The song has become the definitive example of Our Lady Peace's staple sound, highlighted by vocalist Raine Maida's unusual yet powerful falsetto. This song, in contrast to some others on the album, contains very heavy electric guitar, especially in comparison to tracks like "4 A.M." and Carnival". It peaked at number 17 on the Canadian RPM Pop Chart while spending five weeks at number 2 on the RPM Rock and Alternative Chart. In the U.S. it peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Alternative/Modern Rock Chart, while reaching number 14 on the Mainstream Rock Chart.</p>
